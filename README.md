# Explain version control?

Version control is a system that manages changes to a set of files over time. It enables multiple people to collaborate on a project, track the history of changes, and revert to previous versions if needed. The primary goal of version control is to keep track of changes made to files, facilitate collaboration among team members, and maintain a record of the project's development history.

## Explain difference between git and github

Git and GitHub are related concepts, but they serve different purposes in the context of version control and collaborative software development.

**Git:**

**Definition:** Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds and is widely used for managing and tracking changes in source code.

**Functionality:** Git enables multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, tracking changes and versions of the code. It allows for branching, merging, and easily reverting to previous versions of the code. Git operates locally, which means each developer has a complete copy of the repository on their machine.

**Usage:** Developers use Git for tasks such as creating branches for new features or bug fixes, making and committing changes to the code, merging code changes from different branches, and more.

**GitHub:**

**Definition:** GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It adds a layer of collaboration features on top of Git, making it easier for developers to work together.

**Functionality:** GitHub offers a centralized location for hosting Git repositories. It provides a web-based interface for managing repositories, tracking issues, and facilitating collaboration among team members. GitHub also includes features like pull requests, which allow developers to propose changes, review code, and discuss modifications before merging them into the main codebase.

**Usage:** Developers use GitHub to host their Git repositories in a centralized location accessible to the team. It serves as a platform for collaboration, code review, issue tracking, and project management.

In summary, Git is the version control system itself, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories along with collaboration and project management tools. While Git can be used without GitHub, GitHub leverages Git by providing additional features to enhance collaboration and streamline the development workflow. Other similar platforms include GitLab and Bitbucket, each offering its own set of features and integrations.

## Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull

Both git fetch and git pull are Git commands used to update a local repository with changes from a remote repository. However, they have different purposes and behaviors:

- **git fetch:**

  - **Purpose:** The primary purpose of git fetch is to retrieve new changes from a remote repository to the local repository without automatically merging them into the current working branch.
  - **Behavior:** When you run `git fetch`, Git fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and stores them in a separate branch called "remote-tracking branch" or "remote branch." These branches are named like `origin/main` or `origin/master`, where "origin" is the default name for the remote repository.
  - **Use Case:** `git fetch` is useful when you want to see what changes exist on the remote repository before deciding to integrate them into your working branch. It allows you to inspect and review the changes before merging.

- **`git pull`:**
  - **Purpose:** The main purpose of `git pull` is to fetch changes from a remote repository and automatically merge them into the current working branch.
  - **Behavior:** `git pull` is essentially a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`. It fetches the changes from the remote repository and then merges them into the local working branch. This command is convenient for quickly updating your local branch with the latest changes from the remote.
  - **Use Case:** Use `git pull` when you want to update your working branch with the latest changes from the remote repository and automatically merge them.

In summary, `git fetch` fetches changes from the remote repository and stores them in remote-tracking branches without merging into the local working branch. On the other hand, `git pull` does the same fetch operation but additionally merges the changes into the current working branch, providing a more streamlined process for updating your local branch with remote changes. The choice between them depends on whether you want to review changes before merging (`git fetch`) or merge immediately (`git pull`).

## Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it

In simple terms, git rebase is a Git command that allows you to change the base of your current branch to a different commit. It's like rewriting the history of your branch by incorporating changes from another branch or by modifying the order of commits. This can make your commit history cleaner and easier to understand, especially when working on collaborative projects.

The basic idea is to move or "rebase" your changes on top of the changes in another branch, making it appear as if you made your changes directly on the latest version of the other branch.

## Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it

In simple terms, git cherry-pick is a Git command that allows you to copy specific commits from one branch and apply them onto another branch. It's like picking and choosing individual changes (commits) and bringing them into a different branch. This can be useful when you only want to bring specific changes from one branch to another, rather than merging the entire branch.
